# Console Ray Tracer
This is an idea I have been playing around with.

I first ported https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer to c#, it didn't work 100% right. While doing more research I found https://github.com/RayTracing/InOneWeekend, and I decided to try porting that instead. It worked better, but lacked refractions and lights. I then ported the lighting and material algorithm from tinyraytracer to c#.

There are a few controls.

Move with WASD.

Change the fov with Q and E.

Spawn random spheres with R.

Also I suck at markdown.
